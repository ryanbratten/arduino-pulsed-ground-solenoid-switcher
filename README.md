# Arduino Stepper

## Explanation:

### Pins Setup:
inputPin is set to pin 0.
outputPinA and outputPinB are set to pins 3 and 4 respectively.

### Interval Calculation:
The interval for switching solenoids is calculated as 1000 / 60, which gives approximately 16.67 milliseconds (60 Hz frequency).

### State Management:
A boolean solenoidState keeps track of which solenoid is currently active.

### Loop Function:
The loop function reads the state of the input pin.
If the input is HIGH, it checks if the interval has passed using millis() and switches the solenoids accordingly.
If the input is LOW, both solenoids are turned off.
This sketch ensures that the solenoids switch at a frequency of 60 Hz, sharing the load equally. Adjust the pin numbers and the input conditions according to your specific hardware setup.

## Hardware Components

1. **Arduino Board**:
   - An Arduino Uno or any other compatible Arduino board.

2. **Solenoids**:
   - Two 12V solenoids (or solenoids rated for your specific power supply).

3. **Power Supply**:
   - A 12V power supply to drive the solenoids. Ensure the power supply can provide sufficient current for both solenoids.

4. **Transistors/MOSFETs**:
   - Two N-channel MOSFETs (e.g., IRF540) or NPN transistors (e.g., TIP120) to switch the solenoids, as the Arduino cannot directly drive high-current loads.

5. **Diodes**:
   - Two flyback diodes (e.g., 1N4007) to protect the transistors/MOSFETs from the inductive kickback generated by the solenoids.

6. **Resistors**:
   - Two 10k ohm resistors for the transistor/MOSFET gates/bases.

7. **Input Device**:
   - A button, switch, or sensor to provide the input signal to the Arduino.

8. **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**:
   - For prototyping and connecting the components.

9. **Optional Components**:
   - A relay module if you prefer to use relays instead of transistors/MOSFETs for switching.

## Circuit Diagram

1. **Solenoids**:
   - Connect the negative terminals of the solenoids to the drain of the MOSFETs (or the collector of the transistors).
   - Connect the positive terminals of the solenoids to the 12V power supply.

2. **MOSFETs/Transistors**:
   - Connect the source of each MOSFET to ground (or the emitter of the transistors to ground).
   - Connect the gates of the MOSFETs (or the bases of the transistors) to the Arduino output pins (through 10k ohm resistors).

3. **Diodes**:
   - Place a flyback diode across each solenoid, with the cathode to the positive terminal and the anode to the drain/collector.

4. **Input Device**:
   - Connect one terminal of the input device to the 5V pin on the Arduino and the other terminal to the input pin (with a pull-down resistor if needed).
